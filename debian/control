Description: Modified fork of CPython's ast module
 typed_ast is a Python 3 package that provides a Python 2.7 and Python 3
 parser similar to the standard ast library. Unlike ast up to Python 3.7,
 the parsers in typed_ast include PEP 484 type comments and are
 independent of the version of Python under which they are run. The
 typed_ast parsers produce the standard Python AST (plus type comments),
 and are both fast and correct, as they are based on the CPython 2.7 and
 3.7 parsers. typed_ast runs on CPython 3.6-3.10 on Linux, OS X and
 Windows.
